# JackInALantern
The Halloween Party Hosting Game

Jack-in-a-Lantern helps solve a problem that has continued to plague society in recent years: deciding which movie to watch! In this game, inspired by classic haunted house attractions, players must explore and escape a nightmarish forest. Throughout the game, decisions players make help decide which movies are selected for them to watch. In this prototype, the movies are limited to Halloween-themed movies, but can be extended to work for other types of movies as well.
